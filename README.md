Mobile Essentials Gallery Beta
=======

The Mobile Essentials Gallery provides a custom Visual Studio Gallery (also called [Private Galleries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh266746.aspx), but ours is pretty public ;)) with experimental and early prototypes and tools for mobile development on the Xamarin platform.

All extensions are provided free to use and experiment. We welcome your feedback on the tools at our [UserVoice](http://mobileessentials.uservoice.com/) forum!

## Installing

In order to get the new gallery in your Visual Studio 2012 (or later), open `Tools | Options` and configure the page `Environment > Extension Manager` as follows:

Once the gallery is set up, you can go to Visual Studio's `Tools | Extensions and Updates...` menu and a new Mobile Essentials node will appear under the Online category, where you can explore and install the tools:

Updates also show in this same window, under the respective category `Updates > Mobile Essentials`:
